Retrieves the equivalent value from the collection.

This is a very fast operation for `Set`, `FastSet`, `LruSet`, and `LfuSet`,
which are backed by hash tables.
This is also fast for `SortedArray` and `SortedArraySet` by virtue of a binary
search, and `SortedSet`, which is backed by a [splay tree][SplayTree].
