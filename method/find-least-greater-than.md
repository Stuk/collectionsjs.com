---

Finds the smallest value greater than the given value, returning the node
at which it was found, or undefined.

---

Values are compared using the collectionâ€™s intrinsic `contentEquals` and
`contentCompare`, determined at time of construction.

This is fast (logarithmic) and may rotate the underlying splay tree.
