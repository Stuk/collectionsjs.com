Adds values to the end of a collection.

--- |

For purposes of genericity, collections that have an intrinsic relative order
for their values, like a `SortedSet`, support the `push` method but do not
necessarily add the new values to the end of the collection.

As of version 1.1.0 and 2.0.1, `Heap` does not yet support `push` for multiple
values.
