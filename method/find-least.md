Finds the smallest value, returning the node at which it was found, or
undefined.

Values are compared using the collectionâ€™s intrinsic `contentEquals` and
`contentCompare`, determined at time of construction.

This is fast (logarithmic) and performs no rotations of the splay tree backing
the `SortedSet`.
