Returns a sorted array of the values in this collection.

The comparator must be a function that accepts two values and returns a number.

-   less than zero if the left is less than the right
-   more than zero if the left is more than the right
-   equal to zero if the left is either incomparable or equivalent to the right

A comparator for numbers should subtract the right from the left and expresses
both the direction and magnitude of the difference.
If the magnitude of the difference is not meaningful, a comparator *should*
return only *Infinity*, *-Infinity*, or *0*, to increase the usefulness of the
comparator.

The default comparator is `Object.compare`.
