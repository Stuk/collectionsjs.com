An ordered list of values.

--- |

A `List` is backed by a doubly linked list with a head node.

The list has a `head` property to an empty node.
The list begins with the `next` node from the `head`.
The last node of the list is the `prev` node from the `head`.
The `head` represents the node one past the end of the list and has no `value`.

Nodes can be manipulated directly.
Lists use a `Node(value)` property as their node constructor.
It supports `delete()`, `addBefore(node)`, and `addAfter(node)`.
Directly manipulating `next` and `prev` of a node allows for fast splicing.

Nodes can be reused to avoid garbage collector churn.
However, if you do not need to splice, a `Deque` may perform better than `List`.

Lists can be iterated.
The iterator will produce artificial indexes for each value.

Lists provide slow random access by index.
Methods that accept indexes to seek a position will count as they walk to the
sought node.
These methods will always accept a node instead to instantly traverse to a known
position.
