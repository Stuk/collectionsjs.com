A map from keys to buckets, typically arrays.

--- |

A `MultMap` is a thin layer on a `Map`.
The `getDefault` and `set` methods are overriden to ensure that there will
always be a single bucket value intrinsic to each key, always returned by `get`
and only modified by `set`.

The optional `bucket` argument overrides the `MultiMap`â€™s default `bucket(key)`
method, which creates a new bucketsfor a given key.
By default, this method just returns an empty array.

The optional `equals` and `hash` arguments override the `contentEquals` and
`contentHash` methods, which operate on keys of the map to find where to store
entries.
