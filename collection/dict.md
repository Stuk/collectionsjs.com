A mapping from string keys to values.

---

A dictionary is a specialized `map`.
The keys are required to be strings.
With this constraint in place, the mapping can make many simplifying assumptions
and use a plain JavaScript object as its backing store.

```js
var Dict = require("collections/dict");
var dict = new Dict();
```

The `new` keyword is optional.

The optional first argument of the dictionary constructor is an object to copy
into the dictionary initially.
The value to copy may beâ€¦

-   An object literal
-   Any map-like collection with strings for keys
-   Any other kind of collection containing [key, value] pairs.

The optional second argument of the constructor is a `getDefault(key)` function.
This function will be called as a method of the dictionary if the value for a
given key does not exist when a user calls `get(key)`.

```js
var dict = new Dict(null, function (key) {
    return this.get(key.slice(0, key.length - 1));
});
dict.set("a", 10);
expect(dict.get("abcdefg")).toBe(10);
```
