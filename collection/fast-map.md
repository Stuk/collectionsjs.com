The backing store for a `Map`.

--- |

The `FastMap` is a map from arbitrary keys to values.
It is itself backed by a `FastSet` of *[key, value]* entries, with
`contentEquals` and `contentCompare` overridden to consider only the *key*.
The `FastMap` is fast because it does not track insertion order of the entries,
so it will not behave exactly like an ECMAScript 6 `Map` in that regard.
The enumeration order of the map will depend on whether there are hash
collisions.
If there are no hash collisions, its enumeration order is consistent with `Map`.
